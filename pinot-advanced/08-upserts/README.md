# Create Pinot Schema and Table

This folder contains the code for Upserts in Apache Pinot.

## The Exercises

The exercise includes:

- Full Upsert
- Partial Upsert

## Run the docker compose file

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Launching the UI

Once that's run, you can navigate the Pinot UI - [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

## Excercise 1 - Full Upsert

In this excercise, we will create a table that suppots full Upserts.

You should see the following files:

- gitHub_events_offline_table_config.json
- gitHub_events_schema.json

Use the following command to create the table

``` bash
/opt/pinot/bin/pinot-admin.sh AddTable -schemaFile /scripts/orders_schema.json -tableConfigFile /scripts/orders_full_upserts.json -exec 
```

At this point, you should be able to verify that the Table and schema were created by navigating to <http://localhost:9000> and selecting tables.

Next, let's consume some messages:

``` bash

docker exec -it kafka kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic orders

```

and paste the following:

``` json

{"order_id":1,"customer_id":104,"order_status":"IN_TRANSIT","amount":29.35,"ts":"1632467063"}
{"order_id":2,"customer_id":105,"order_status":"COMPLETED","amount":3.24,"ts":"1618931459"}
{"order_id":3,"customer_id":103,"order_status":"OPEN","amount":9.77,"ts":"1626484196"}
{"order_id":4,"customer_id":104,"order_status":"COMPLETED","amount":90.35,"ts":"1623066325"}
{"order_id":5,"customer_id":105,"order_status":"OPEN","amount":55.52,"ts":"1635543905"}

```

Next, from a query UI [http://localhost:9000/#/query](http://localhost:9000/#/query)
query:

``` SQL
select * 
from orders 
limit 10
```

Next, let's try the usert, navigate to the Kafka tab and paste the following:

``` json
{"order_id":5,"customer_id":105,"order_status":"CANCELLED","amount":55.52,"ts":"1635543948"}
```

Validate that the record was REPLACEd by re-runnning the previous query.

## Validate deployment

Make sure:

- 3 Schemas are created
- 3 Tables are created

## Success

There! You've just created upserts in Apache Pinot!
